# DSA-notes

## What is DSA?
Data Structure Algorithm is to simply place and store data in an organized manner. <br />
For example: Array <br />
We can store data in Data Array, Stack, Queue are type of data structure where we can store data so that we can use it for particular purpose. <br />

## Types of Data Structure
Primitive- int, flow <br />
Non-Primitive- Array, Stack, Queue <br />

## Why do you need to learn Data Structure?
•	To organize data <br />
•	Storage of data <br />
•	Retrieval of data <br />
•	Manipulation of data <br />

## Advantages and Real Use of Data Structure In Domain Name Structure
•	DS allow into storage on hard disk <br />
•	It manages large data <br />
•	It is necessary for designing of efficient algorithm <br />

## What is an Algorithm?
Algorithm is a set of instructions which leads to a step procedure for solving a given problem. <br />

## What are the properties of Algorithm
1.	Input: Whatever instructions are entered by the programmers. <br />
2.	Output: Atleast one outcome will be produced. <br />
3.	Definiteness: Each instruction should be clear and unambiguous. <br /> 
4.	Finiteness: Every algorithm with terminate after a certain number of steps and it is called finiteness. <br />
5.	Effectiveness: Every instruction must be sufficiently basic that it can in principle be carried out by a person using pencil and paper <br />

## Classification of Data Structure
Linear DS: If elements or items are stored in sequence, it is called Linear Data Structure. <br />
Non-Linear DS: Not stored in sequence, elements, or items. Example: Tree, graphs, etc. <br />
